# EMNIST-recognizer
Handwritten Character Recognition using SVM, NN and CNN


## Goal
1. Develop a handwritten character recognition model using the [EMNIST](https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/image-group/emnist-dataset) dataset 
2. Explore different Machine Learning Algorithms:
    - Support Vector Machine
    - Simple Feedforward Neural Networks
    - Convolutional Neural Networks
